OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Squad 36, and like, WHAT was that ending? I'm so lost right now, I can’t even. 😂 I was rooting for Margo the whole time, and then bam! They throw that curveball. Who writes these things?? 🤦‍♀️

> You know, it started off all epic and stuff — explosions, that soundtrack was fire, had me hooked like crazy. But then somewhere in the middle, it’s like they just stopped caring. Seriously, did anyone else notice how it went from this intense spy mission to, like, a random dance-off? LOL what even?! I swear the director just lost a bet or something. 

My favorite part has to be when Joe tries to explain his master plan with those confusing graphs. Bro, just say you’re winging it! No one’s buying your “genius” strategy. 😂 And don’t even get me started on the fight choreography—my grandma could do better with a rolling pin. Anyway, I kinda loved it, you know what I mean? It's like that guilty pleasure type of bad where you can't stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨.

Honestly, next time I'm just gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and skip to the good parts. Just me and my popcorn, no time for that filler nonsense. Seriously tho, I wonder why I even care. It’s so ridiculous, I love that I hate it, or hate that I love it? Ugh, brain fried. 🤯

Just realized I forgot to eat dinner, oops. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨  s like it's a second job over here. 😅 Also, Margo’s outfits—slay, but who fights in heels that high? Mad respect, but also, seriously? How didn’t she just fall over during that rooftop sprint? I’d have face-planted by the second step.

for(int i=0; i < 5; i++) { cout << Why am I even doing this?; }

Okay, enough   talk. But like, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you haven't—it’s a trip, literally. You’ve gotta catch those weird plot twists. Anyway, I need a nap or a coffee or both, this   has me rethinking my life choices. Hit me up later, yeah?
